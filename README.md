# CU Boulder Faculty-Course Questionaire

To use, run `python3 main.py` in the directory containing `main.py` (this is the outer-most directory).

Users can sign in and out, but there is no benefit to having an account (yet!). Also, passwords are hashed, so I don't see any sensitive data!

Currently, the search function only works with correctly-formatted queries in the form `xxxx####` (e.g., "csci3010" or "CSCI3010", etc.). The user will get back the raw data from the database on all matching records for that class.

A `requirements.txt` file is on the way, but currently not available.

Have fun!
