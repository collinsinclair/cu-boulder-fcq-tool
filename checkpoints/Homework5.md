# Homework 5

## Planned

* For the next homework, the app will be done! The user will be able to write many types of queries and get summary results with plots back. They will also be able to add classes to their account and see aggregate statistic for several classes at once.

## Accomplished

* The app is done! I changed direction a bit after consulting several peers about how they would use the tool. Folks seem to be more interested in accessing information that will shape their decisions in selecting courses. Additionally, writing a very robust search parser is quite challenging, especially since CU reuses many of their acronyms. My code for a more robust parser exists, but is not currently in use. Also, the app is currently very slow, and this is something I would like to fix in the future.

## Demo

See video on Canvas.
