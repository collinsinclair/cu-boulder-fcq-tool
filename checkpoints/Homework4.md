# Homework 4

## Planned

* Finish the login/sign-up feature
* Python object structure and definition, statistical analysis. Users can use Python to get numerical statistical insights back based on queries to the FQC database. Users can sign in and save classes to a schedule, and make arbitrarily many schedule objects.

## Accomplished

* Finished login/sign-up feature: users can create and account / login and their credentials are written to the database. The password is hashed and I do not see sensitive info. Users will remain logged in across sessions.
* Simply, correctly-formatted queries: users can search for a specific class (xxxx####, e.g., CSCI3010) and see the results from the database. I wanted to have aggregate summary results (just numerical) done, but the library I'm using for accessing the database (SQLAlchemy) is unfamiliar to me and has proven to require a lot more work than I anticipated to get the results and use them. I'm also not sure what this application will require RE: OOP. I know that OOP is an important part of the project since it is what we have largely focussed on in class, though I don't want to overcomplicate the code *if* it is unneeded. We shall see.

## Plan

* For the next homework, the app will be done! The user will be able to write many different types of queries and get summary results with plots back. They will also be able to add classes to their account and see aggregate statistic for several classes at once.

## Demo
