# Homework 3

## Planned for This Deadline

* Create a database and populate a table with FCQ results. Users should be able to query the database and get results.
* A functional login/sign-up page that remembers credentials.

## Accomplished

The following updates to my projects are present for this checkpoint:

* A scaffolding for the Express.js framework linking the front-end to the back-end (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.babelrc`) with basic functionality and working `GET` and `PUT` HTTP calls.
* A connection to the database which contains the FCQ data in third normal form (`pg-connect.js`)
* Updated web pages that incorporate the files listed above to begin functionality development

The PostgreSQL server is up and running on my labtop, along with the table of FCQ entries in 3NF, but I am not sure how to display that on Git with functionality. For now, I will link a screenshot of the table.

**Note:** I did not finish the login/sign-up functionally - I am still working on understanding secure authentication, and expressing it through Express.js (my chosen "middle-ware"). Evidently, there is a lot more to secure user authentication than I had planned for, and I have a lot of learning to prior to implementing this feature.

## Plan for Next Deadline

* Finish the login/sign-up feature
* Python object structure and definition, statistical analysis. Users can use Python to get numerical statistical insights back based on queries to the FQC database. Users can sign in and save classes to a schedule, and make arbitrarily many schedule objects.
