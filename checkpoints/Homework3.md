# Homework 3


## Done

The following updates to my projects are present for this checkpoint:

* A scaffolding for the Express.js framework linking the front-end to the back-end (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.babelrc`) with basic functionality and working `GET` and `PUT` HTTP calls.
* A connection to the database which contains the FCQ data in third normal form (`pg-connect.js`)
* Updated web pages that incorporate the files listed above to begin functionality development

The PostgreSQL server is up and running on my labtop, along with the table of FCQ entries in 3NF, but I am not sure how to display that on Git with functionality. For now, I will link a screenshot of the table.

## Still Needs Work

The only feautre outlined in my proposal that is not fully functional is the user sign-in process. I am still working on understanding secure authentication, and expressing it through Express.js (my chosen "middle-ware").
